# sdfEngine - remote access to graphics canvas via emacs. 

An asset engine for rendering 2D/3D assets using ray marching/ray tracing techniques. Includes a Elisp script to remotely access the graphics canvas 
so you can write from your favourite text editor, as well as see the changes 
live by using your own emacs key-bindings.
